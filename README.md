## Matrix Operations

Develop a console application with Java and build a UML Activity Diagram for your app. Your application must perform Matrix Operations per the user's choice and the data entered.

## Implementation Notes

1. Your app will have only one source file (.java). This source file will contain a main method, and many public methods to reflect matrix operations.
The menu must display the names of team members and include some kind of *ASCII
art*.
2. Your application should continue running unless the user wants to terminate.
3. You must inform the user about the constraint on the size of the matrix for each operation before getting related values. (e.g. n x n matrix must be given for inverse operation while 5≥n≥2)
4. Assume that, the user will select between 2 and 5 (including 2 and 5) for the number of rows and columns without making any mistake.
5. Assume that, the user will enter values as double for each cell.
6. If the operation fails, inform the user of the related reason. (e.g. The entered matrix is non-invertible)
7. For each operation, the screen will be cleared.
8. No other packages will be used other than the ones we see in lectures, except console clearing.
