# CMPE343_Project_1
## Matrix Operations

# To Do
- [ ]  Matrix addition,
- [ ] Matrix subtraction,
- [ ] Matrix multiplication,
- [ ] Matrix division,
- [ ] Scalar multiplication of the matrix,
- [ ] Transpose of the matrix,
- [ ] The inverse of the matrix,
- [ ] Trace of the matrix,
- [ ] Adjoint of the matrix,
- [ ] Check the matrix for Orthogonality,
- [ ] Terminate
- [ ] Basic information of the operation

## Implementation Notes
1. Your app will have only one source file (.java). This source file will contain a main method, and many public methods to reflect matrix operations.
The menu must display the names of team members and include some kind of ASCII
art.
2. Your application should continue running unless the user wants to terminate.
3. You must inform the user about the constraint on the size of the matrix for each operation before getting related values. (e.g. n x n matrix must be given for inverse operation while 5≥n≥2)
4. Assume that, the user will select between 2 and 5 (including 2 and 5) for the number of rows and columns without making any mistake.
5. Assume that, the user will enter values as double for each cell.
6. If the operation fails, inform the user of the related reason. (e.g. The entered matrix is non-invertible)
7. For each operation, the screen will be cleared.
8. No other packages will be used other than the ones we see in lectures, except console clearing.
9. Please make sure your code runs without errors when you submit your projects
